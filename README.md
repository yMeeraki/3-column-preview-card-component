### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to use **branching** and **pull requests** effectively in Git and GitHub. This was crucial for maintaining a clean and organized workflow, especially when working on different features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

Hereâ€™s a quick example of how I created a new branch:

```
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```

This command creates a new branch and switches to it immediately, allowing me to work on a specific feature independently from the main branch. Once the feature was completed, I committed my changes and pushed the branch to GitHub:

```
git push origin new-feature-branch
```

Then, I opened a pull request (PR) to merge my changes into the main branch. This is how the code review process happened and ensured code quality before merging:

```
# Example command to merge PR after approval
git merge new-feature-branch
```

By using branches and pull requests, I can keep the main branch stable and ensure that every feature or fix gets reviewed before it becomes part of the main codebase.


### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to continue refining my skills in advanced CSS techniques, particularly in the use of responsive design and CSS Grid. Additionally, I plan to explore more complex layouts and interactivity using JavaScript, even though I did not use JavaScript in this project. Enhancing my knowledge of accessibility and performance optimization will also be a key focus moving forward.
